            <p>My grandma has a cabin in Colorado and my family and I go out every year to visit. The cabin is located in Alpine. It used to be an old mining town. Now it is used for summer homes and vacationing. There are a ton of activites to do while there like hiking and fishing, or just getting to see the beautiful view. I spent a four days at the cabin and this is what I got to do:</p>
            <p>My grandma's cabin is my second home. It is the only place I go to year after year and it always seems like I am adding things on my to-do list for the next year.</p>
            <p>My favorite part about Alpine is all the wildlife that I get to see. My grandma has a hummingbird feeder by the dining room window and those hummingbirds are so much fun to watch. She also has a box out in the front yard where she puts cracked corn so the deer can come up and eat. If the deer are tame enough, they will eat out of your hand.</p>

        <div class = "main">
            <p> On the first day of the trip, I like to recooperate from the long drive so I did a lot of relaxing around the cabin.</p>
            <p>Later on in the day, I went up to St. Elmo. It used to be an old mining town. Now it is where you can feed chipmunks.</p>
            <p>I have to visit St. Elmo at least once when I go to Colorado. It's one of my favorite places to visit. There is also a gift shop where you can buy a gift or have a snack.</p>

            <p>In the evening, I went into Buena Vista and ate some delicious pizza. The restaurant I ate at is called Eddyline. They serve woodfire pizza and have a selection of beers on tap.</p>

        <div class = "main">
            <p>My favorite thing to do while in Colorado is go hiking. The weather is perfect for hiking because it usually doesn't get too hot. You can start off with easy hikes then get more advanced.</p>
            <p>There are trails you an walk along or if you are feeling really adventurous, you can hike a fourteener. I am always cautious about wildlife whenever I go hiking.</p>
            <p>I went on an easy hike on my second day in Colorado. It is called Brown's Creek Trail</p>

            <p>After a long day of hiking, I went to a nearby town called Leadville and ate some steak. The restaurant is called Quincy's. It is my favorite place to go to when I visit Colorado!</p>

            <p>I've always wanted to go ziplining while in Colorado and I finally got to go. The views were absolutely beautiful! I went ziplinning at MountainTop Zipline Tour in Buena Vista, CO. They were very informative and I felt safe. I am scared of heights so I was nervous to go. I recommend going to this place.</p>

            <p>While I was in Buena Vista, I decided to shop around and eat. There are a ton of small shops that you can look at.</p>
            <p>Whenever I am in Buena Vista, I try to stop and eat at K's Dairy Delite. It reminds me of being a kid because my parents would always stop here to eat with us. It is very kid friendly. There is a park next to the restaurant with picnic tables set up so you can eat outside and the kids can play after eating.</p>

            <p>Sadly this was my last day in Colorado. I went to Salida to do more shopping and there is a restaurant that I really like going to.</p>
            <p>I ate at Boathouse Cantina. This restaurant sits on the river. Often times, you can see kayakers practicing in the river. It is a very casual, laid back environment. The food is always good and they have a variety of things on their menu.</p>
